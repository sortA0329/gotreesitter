# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
for tags and release notes while still in `0.x`.

## [Unreleased]

- Nothing yet.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- `SkipTreeParse` hook on `ParsePolicy` — allows consumers to read file source bytes without paying for a full tree-sitter AST parse. When the hook returns true, the gateway populates `Source` but leaves `Tree` nil. Enables fast regex-based symbol extraction for large generated files (protobuf stubs, codegen output) that would otherwise stall the parser for minutes.

### Changed
- LR0/LALR construction uses packed 4-byte core entries, bucketed kernel maps, and inlined context-tag computation to reduce GC pressure and allocations during grammar generation.
- Performance pass: reduced allocations across injection arenas, query execution, tagger, and sexp serialization.

### Fixed
- Injection fast-path now uses document-relative coordinates instead of node-relative.

## [0.12.2] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- Bounded Docker presets for Fortran real-corpus grammargen runs, plus focused SQL imported-parity and direct-C regression coverage.
- Additional C#, YAML, Rust, and SQL parity tests and parser result helpers carried in from the `yaml-parity-drive` integration branch.

### Changed
- Large-grammar grammargen generation now uses lower-memory LR0/LALR data structures, tighter scratch reuse, and configurable generation budgets/timeouts to keep Fortran investigation lanes bounded.
- Parser-result normalization is split across smaller language-focused files to make recovery logic easier to maintain and extend.

### Fixed
- Imported SQL `grammar.json` round-trips no longer conflate anonymous string literals with inline regex terminals that share the same display text, restoring the affected `SELECT`/`INSERT` parity cases.
- LALR lookahead bitset initialization is now lazy-safe for tests that construct `lrContext` directly.
- `Node.Text()` edge cases, scanner adaptation, and several C#/YAML/Rust recovery and parity regressions were corrected on the merged branch.

## [0.12.1] - 2026-03-28

### Changed
- Refreshed the README roadmap/version snapshot so it reflects the shipped `grammargen` release line and the current parser/performance priorities.

### Fixed
- `grammars/scanner_lookup_test.go` no longer copies a full `Language` value when checking scanner adaptation, avoiding the `go vet` lock-copy failure caused by embedded `sync.Once` fields.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- `grammargen` now imports and emits tree-sitter ABI 15 reserved-word sets, preserving reserved-word metadata through grammar extension and normalization.
- Added Python pattern-matching and f-string parity coverage, plus comprehensive YAML and C# parity and regression suites including a Docker-isolated C# CGO regression lane.
- Added parser recovery and normalization coverage for Rust dot ranges, Rust token trees and struct expressions, YAML recovered roots, and C# namespaces, query expressions, type declarations, Unicode identifiers, and implicit `var` restoration.

### Changed
- GLR stack equivalence checks now skip recursive frontier descent where possible and cache frontier equivalence per parse to reduce duplicate merge work on ambiguous parses.

### Fixed
- Restored Python real-corpus parity with keyword-leaf repair, print and interpolation normalization, and trailing self-call recovery in repaired blocks.
- Tightened Rust parity for macro token bindings, token trees, pattern statements, recovered function items, and struct-expression spans.
- Imported-language scanner adaptation now preserves existing `ExternalLexStates` instead of overwriting them during scanner wiring.

## [0.11.2] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- Focused TypeScript and TSX snippet parity cases for const type parameters, template literal types, enums, and class method bodies drawn from corpus-style inputs.
- COBOL snippet parity coverage for close/open statements, PIC forms, and `perform ... varying` cases that previously escaped smaller parity checks.
- CSS to the curated `cgo_harness` focus-target board so it runs through the same isolated real-corpus and cgo parity entrypoints as the other tracked grammars.

### Fixed
- DFA token selection now evaluates base and after-whitespace lex modes from one shared path, restoring CSS function-value parity and JavaScript template-string corpus parity without skipping valid immediate tokens.
- Imported-language parity adapts external scanners more defensively, including lowercase grammar-name lookup, so generated COBOL scanner wiring stays aligned with embedded references.
- Hidden passthrough flattening preserves transitive alternatives without recursing indefinitely, keeping COBOL normalization parity-safe on imported grammars.
- The COBOL real-corpus lane no longer forces the choice-lifting threshold that was driving deep-parity regressions.

## [0.11.1] - 2026-03-25

### Changed
- `grammargen` skips conflict diagnostics and provenance on the plain `GenerateLanguage` fast path unless a report or LR splitting actually needs them.

### Fixed
- Restored CSS real-corpus parity to 25/25 on no-error, sexpr parity, and deep parity.
- Tightened parser and `grammargen` parity across C/C++, JavaScript/TypeScript/TSX, COBOL, and C# normalization paths.
- Fixed after-whitespace lex modes, unary reduction collapse, and Python pass-statement normalization regressions called out in the `v0.11.1` release.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- Grammar subset support with build tags and blob overrides for smaller focused builds.
- Race-test guards for heavyweight suites so correctness coverage can stay enabled without host OOM pressure.

### Changed
- Broad-lex fallback in `grammargen` became environment-controlled instead of always-on.
- Grammar parity coverage expanded again, including explicit-precedence handling in imported grammars.

### Fixed
- COBOL division and `perform` span normalization.
- Scala compilation-unit reconstruction and Go trivia-boundary handling in the runtime parser.

## [0.10.1] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- Re-registering a grammar now replaces the existing entry instead of appending a duplicate registration.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- `grammargen.GenerateLanguageAndBlob` and `GenerateLanguageAndBlobWithContext` for one-pass compiled language plus blob output.
- Smoke and exhaustive parity modes in `cgo_harness` so required CI stays fast while deeper validation remains available.
- Pattern-based keyword detection, `ChoiceLiftThreshold`, and broader large-grammar controls in `grammargen`.

### Changed
- Large-grammar generation now uses wider `StateID` values and additional LALR/LR performance work to stay tractable on bigger grammars.

### Fixed
- Parity and normalization regressions across CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript/TSX, Python, Haskell, C/C++, Scala, and external-token handling.
- Immediate-token, after-whitespace lex-mode, and hidden external-token behavior in `grammargen` and the runtime parser.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- `ExtensionEntry.InheritHighlights` for dynamic grammar highlight inheritance.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- `grammars.LoadLanguageFromBlob` for loading compiled language blobs directly at runtime.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- Initial `grammargen` release with grammar composition support and runtime integration work.
- Split WASM builds for the runtime and `grammargen`, plus browser-side runtime support for client-side highlighting.
- `RegisterExtension`-era dynamic grammar work, including the LSP proxy and related runtime improvements.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- Highlight-query inheritance for TypeScript and TSX, fixing the major capture drop in those bundled highlight queries.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- Structural `grep` engine with metavariables, `where`/`replace` blocks, rewrite support, and integration coverage.
- Concurrent grammar gateway for walking and parsing files, plus binary-file detection, cancellation guards, and progress reporting.
- Walk-and-parse integration tests, docs, and metadata-only `AllLanguages` enumeration.

## [0.7.4] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- Reordered the JSON highlight query so object keys win the intended highlight priority.

## [0.7.3] - 2026-03-16

### Added

- All 206 grammars now produce error-free parse trees (previously 3 degraded).

### Fixed
- Swift C parity: lock file updated to match the grammar used for blob generation.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-03-15

- GLR engine tuned: lazy GSS node hashing in single-stack mode, key-based stack culling, small-path merge optimization, temporary stack oversubscription before culling.
- Query engine optimized: dense array for root pattern lookup, compile-time alternation matching index, avoid heap allocation for candidate indices.
- Go and TypeScript normalization refactored to symbol-based context; span attribution switched on language.

### Fixed
- Top-50 parity burndown: broad fixes across lexers, normalization, scanners, and GLR paths reducing degraded grammars to 0.
- GLR robustness: deterministic stack culling, correct tie-breaking for duplicate stacks, all-dead stack recovery, preferred visible tokens in union DFA on exact ties, higher action specificity on same lexeme.
